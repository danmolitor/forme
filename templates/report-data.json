        "Fiscal year 2025 marked a period of sustained growth for Cascadia Holdings, with consolidated revenue reaching $142 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. This growth was driven primarily by expansion in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast regions, along with strong adoption of our enterprise product line.",

Net new customer acquisition grew 22% year-over-year, with particular strength in the mid-market segment where our competitive positioning improved substantially.",
        "Operating margins expanded by 2.3 percentage points to 31.4%, driven by economies of scale in our fulfillment operations and a disciplined approach to headcount growth. We ended the fiscal year with 847 full-time employees across 12 offices.",
        "Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity in international expansion and adjacent product categories. The strategic priorities outlined in this report reflect our commitment to sustainable growth while maintaining the operational excellence that has defined our trajectory."
